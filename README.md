# Data Structures in Java

This repository serves as a collection of various fundamental data structures implemented in Java. It contains individual repositories for each of the following data structures:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Set (HashSet & TreeSet)
- Map (HashMap & TreeMap)

Each of these data structures is implemented in its own repository with detailed explanations and code. Below are the links to each individual repository:
